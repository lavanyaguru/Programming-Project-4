When I first read the spec of the project, I was pretty excited to see the problem, it seemed creative to implement and not boring. It was a fun problem to solve since there was a real life aspect to it which I could relate it. However, I thought Prolog was a challenging language since I never had any exposure to it before and the spec seemed overwhelming with all the technical aspects.
